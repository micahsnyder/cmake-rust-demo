# The unit tests for the demorust module dependends on the C library and may even need
# to be linked with the C library's 3rd party library dependencies. So to be able to build
# that application, we'll need to pass these things through the environment.
# Thus, we'll set all of that up and add the Rust-test in `tests/CMakelists.txt`.
